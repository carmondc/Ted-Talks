## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The codes should run with no issues using Python version 3. 

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
I'm interested in Ted Talks data from 2017 to do a better understanding in:
1. Which are the most viewed and most favorited Talks of all time?
2. What kind of topics attract the maximum discussion and debate(in the form of comments)?
3. Who have managed to inspire millions of people through their talks on the TED Platform?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The notebook available here showcases work related to the above question. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://carmond-chong.medium.com/the-world-of-ted-a4f64fb9fb86)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgments<a name="licensing"></a>
The data was scrapped from the official TED website and is available under the Creative Commons License. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle's link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks).
